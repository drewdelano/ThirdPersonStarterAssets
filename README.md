I'm experimenting with learning Unity.  I spent a couple of hours struggling with this trying to get to a point where I could complete the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P033bFcwYWU) so I thought I would just wrap this up into a repo that will hopefully save someone else some time.

 - https://github.com/spoiledcat/git-for-unity

What did I do?
 - Installed the Starter Asset pack above and allowed it to upgrade the packages
 - Set the Input System on the player object in the project settings menu to "BOTH"
 - Added "[Git for Unity](https://github.com/spoiledcat/git-for-unity)" package
 - I think I updated the build pipeline to URP / Universal, but it might have done this automatically
 - Imported the assets from [Starter Assets - ThirdPerson](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-thirdperson-updates-in-new-charactercontroller-pa-196526)

This is clearly not a finished project or even something you would want to base a project on, but I thought it would be good if it helps people more easily access the tutorial above.

Thanks,
Drew
